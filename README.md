# missing-firmware-fix
So, you're faced the "Possible Missing Firmware" message during kernel generation on your Linux system. This is a fairly common problem and this script is the solution.

The usage is very simple: just download the script, make it executable and run it as sudo:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UrbanVampire/missing-firmware-fix/main/missing-firmware-fix.sh

chmod +x missing-firmware-fix.sh

'sudo ./missing-firmware-fix.sh'
